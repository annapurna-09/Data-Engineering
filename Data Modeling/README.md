## Data Modeling

### Data Modeling using NoSQL dabase Cassandra
In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data modeling with Apache Cassandra and complete an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, you will need to model your data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries. You are provided with part of the ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.

### Data Modeling using a SQL database PostgreSQL 
In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data modeling with PostgreSQL and complete an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, you will need to model your data by creating fact and dimesion tables for a Star Schema for a specific focus. On the other hand, ETL pipeline would transfer data from files located in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.
